- The starter theme is based on the [Jekyll Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
- The admin UI design is based on [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) components and blocks.
- The admin UI frontend uses [Cherry](https://github.com/squint-cljs/cherry) for compiling ClojureScript.
- The plugin system uses code derived from [neil](https://github.com/babashka/neil) for managing `deps.edn` files.
